			<p class=" text-base  pt-10 "><strong>I wrote code for the first time in middle school: C++ on a piece of paper. </strong>My school in Cochin, India, didn’t have enough computers to run everyone’s code, so my early experience with programming was brief and uneventful. After high school, I attended NIFT in Chennai, India’s most selective design university, where <strong>I studied design for four semesters.</strong> But in 2020, my family finally received green cards after a 20-year wait and moved to America, settling in Chicago.</p>

            <p class=" text-base ">In Chicago, a decade after those handwritten C++ assignments, I tried programming again. <strong>It turns out, writing code is actually a lot of fun when you have a computer to run it on! </strong>I started building projects with JavaScript and Python and learning web fundamentals with HTML and CSS. After transferring to The University of Illinois, Chicago, I deepened my study of computer science and software development.</p>

            <p class=" text-base pb-20 ">I’ve combined my background in design with my knowledge of web technologies to specialize in front-end development. <strong>I enjoy designing and building engaging user experiences and care about making my projects accessible.</strong> If you’re interested in collaborating, please get in touch. I look forward to discovering what we build together!</p>
